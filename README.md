To begin, download the project from the provided GitHub URL or clone it. 

By using the command git clone "Project URL", which will create the project folder in your current working directory. After the project folder is created, navigate into it by using the cd command. 

Once inside the project directory, run the command python manage.py runserver to start the server.  

This will generate a local server URL, typically http://127.0.0.1:8000/, which will appear in the command prompt. Finally, open a web browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/mypolls
